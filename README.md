# Automation-Hackathon

## Project Overview

This project automates the use of RESTCONF API to send requests to CIENA's management software (NAVIGATOR NCS) and retrieve information about the inventory of equipment that makes up the sites of a network.

After retrieving the data, it is stored in a JSON file. The information is then processed and saved into an Excel file, with each site having its own dedicated sheet.

## Motivation

The telecommunications environment is complex, comprising a wide array of interconnected equipment. Efficient management of these assets is crucial to the operational success of any service provider. This project was motivated by the need to automate and streamline the process of generating comprehensive inventory reports for network equipment.

Accurate reports are essential for better resource allocation and investment planning. Furthermore, having an organized and up-to-date equipment inventory facilitates internal and external audits, ensuring compliance and operational transparency. A detailed overview of the existing infrastructure is also critical for planning network expansions or future upgrades, allowing for informed decisions that enhance network performance and scalability.
